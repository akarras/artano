# Artano

> For adding text to pictures

Based on the `image` and `imageproc` crates. Remind me to update this when `imageproc` releases a new version...

This crate is, clearly, named for the Dark Lord Sauron. The name is taken from the Quenya, meaning 'High Smith.' So it's for making evil things--like memes.
